# Job-Acceptance-ML

The goal of this project is to try to accurately predict the status of a job candidate, after a job offer is presented. This is useful to reduce costs of the hiring company, as a candidate's rejection will raise costs to the process of filling the position.

## This project was divided in the following way:
- ### Data Collection
  - Data collected from Harvard Business School article 'HR Analytics at ScaleneWorks: Behavioral Modelling to Predict Renege'
- ### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Explored the data to gain familiarity with the dataset
  - Created and transformed variables to fit the machine learning models using the Python libraries pandas and numpy
- ### Machine Learning Models - Implementation and Evaluation
  - KNN model, using Python library sklearn
    - F1 score obtained was 85.78%
    - Accuracy score obtained was 76.70%
  - Logistic Regression model, using Python library sklearn
    - Accuracy score obtained was 76.14%
